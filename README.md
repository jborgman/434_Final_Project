434_Final_Project
=================
This will be our final project repository.

The AudioAnalyzerMix.vi records the input of a microphone and saves the recording in a .wav file. There is an optional application of a band-pass filter. 

The soundIn_out.vi performs a mixing and analysis of two .wav files.
